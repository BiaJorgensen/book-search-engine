## Description
Book Search Engine project is a refactoring project. The objective was to refactor a React web application originally built with a RESTful API to a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. This app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. The app itself is a book search engine that allows users to search books (users will be presented with several search results, each featuring a bookâ€™s title, authors, description and image) and save them into their account if they are logged in.<br>
This project is part of a challenge from Full Stack Coding Bootcamp at the University of Minnesota.

## Usage

1. Open [deployed application](https://bia-jorgensen-book-engine.herokuapp.com/)
1. On the `Search For Books` page, enter a search term in the input field and click the `Submit Search` button
    * You will be presented with several search results; if you wish to save them, you will need to be logged in; if you are logged in, you can select `Save this Book!`
1. If you wish to to access your account or to create one, select `Login/Sign Up`
1. Once you are logged in, you can see your saved books by selecting `See Your Books`

1. Books that are saved into your account will show as `This book has already been saved!` when you search for them again.
1. Select `Logout` to log out of the app.
    * When you log back in, you can still see your saved books (if any) in `See Your Books`
